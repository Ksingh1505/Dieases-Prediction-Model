Project Description: Disease Prediction Model

The Disease Prediction Model is a machine learning–based solution developed to assist in the early detection and classification of potential diseases based on patient health data. The primary objective of this model is to analyze clinical and physiological attributes and predict the likelihood of a disease, enabling timely intervention and improved medical decision-making.

The system uses patient input parameters such as age, gender, medical history, symptoms, and diagnostic test values (e.g., glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc.). These inputs are preprocessed through data cleaning, feature scaling, and encoding techniques. After preprocessing, the model is trained using supervised learning algorithms. Various classifiers are evaluated including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to determine the best-performing model.

The prediction output assists healthcare professionals by providing insights into disease risk, improving diagnosis accuracy, and helping reduce manual errors. The system can be extended to multiple diseases and can be integrated into healthcare applications for real-time monitoring and prediction.
